The aim of this application is to generate automatically a changelog based on Git repository messages.

The goal is to get a well formed Changelog, with sections for each type of [AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#). I recommend to use this format, not only for generating automatic changelog but also for finding easier whatever you are looking for.

Probably not everybody use the same "git commit message conventions", so it will be nice create a configuration file where customize a little this behaviour.
